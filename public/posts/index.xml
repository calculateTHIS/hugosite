      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first official blog post! Yay! So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few things to cover
today, and the biggest thing is that the site is now given life! Yay!
So, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; neat! The other thing is I&amp;rsquo;m going to finalize the first
couple projects I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;calculus-book-chosen&#34;&gt;Calculus Book Chosen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculus is a huge one. It&amp;rsquo;s fundamental to all the studies I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing, so
I would really like to knock that out of the way first. But because it&amp;rsquo;s so
important, it&amp;rsquo;ll be wise to go through slowly. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to determine
the pacing. I think most of it should be quick refreshers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Calculus is a huge one. It&amp;rsquo;s fundamental to all the studies I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing, so
I would really like to knock that out of the way first. But because it&amp;rsquo;s so
important, it&amp;rsquo;ll be wise to go through slowly. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to determine
the pacing. I think most of it should be quick refreshers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with a book I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a couple years: &lt;em&gt;Calculus:
Early Transcendentals, 6E&lt;/em&gt; by James Stewart. My first calculus book was this
one and it kinda holds a place in my heart. If you want to get the same edition
that&amp;rsquo;s fine, but any edition and really any calculus book should be able to
let you follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;chemistry-book-chosen&#34;&gt;Chemistry Book Chosen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemistry is also great. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at it, and the calculations can get
rigorous but never too complicated, at least until P-Chem and Inorganic. So,
I&amp;rsquo;ll get started on Chemistry soon too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book I&amp;rsquo;m going to follow is &lt;em&gt;Chemistry: The Central Science&lt;/em&gt; by Brown,
LeMay and Bursten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;physics-book-chosen&#34;&gt;Physics Book Chosen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics is central to both of my research interests: nanotechnology and quantum
technology (quantum computers/electronics, entanglement devices, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with is &lt;em&gt;Matter and Interactions 3rd Edition&lt;/em&gt; by
Chabay and Sherwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;electronics-project-chosen&#34;&gt;Electronics Project chosen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got an electronics kit in the mail from inventr.io or somesuch. It&amp;rsquo;s
called &lt;code&gt;Cogsworth City&lt;/code&gt; and is supposed to teach you microcontroller electronics
with a gamified modules. Seems like a cool way to refresh my electronic skills.&lt;/p&gt;
