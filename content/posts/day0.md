This is my first official blog post! Yay! So I've got a few things to cover
today, and the biggest thing is that the site is now given life! Yay!
So, that's **really** neat! The other thing is I'm going to finalize the first
couple projects I'm going to work on.

# Calculus Book Chosen

Calculus is a huge one. It's fundamental to all the studies I'll be doing, so
I would really like to knock that out of the way first. But because it's so
important, it'll be wise to go through slowly. I guess I'll have to determine
the pacing. I think most of it should be quick refreshers.

That said, I'm going to go with a book I've had for a couple years: *Calculus: 
Early Transcendentals, 6E* by James Stewart. My first calculus book was this
one and it kinda holds a place in my heart. If you want to get the same edition
that's fine, but any edition and really any calculus book should be able to
let you follow along.

# Chemistry Book Chosen

Chemistry is also great. I'm pretty good at it, and the calculations can get
rigorous but never too complicated, at least until P-Chem and Inorganic. So,
I'll get started on Chemistry soon too.

The book I'm going to follow is *Chemistry: The Central Science* by Brown, 
LeMay and Bursten. 

# Physics Book Chosen

Physics is central to both of my research interests: nanotechnology and quantum
technology (quantum computers/electronics, entanglement devices, etc).

The book I'm going to start with is *Matter and Interactions 3rd Edition* by 
Chabay and Sherwood.

# Electronics Project chosen

I also got an electronics kit in the mail from inventr.io or somesuch. It's
called `Cogsworth City` and is supposed to teach you microcontroller electronics
with a gamified modules. Seems like a cool way to refresh my electronic skills.
