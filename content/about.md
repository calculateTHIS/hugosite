This blog is a record of my journey. Many years ago, I dreamt of going to
graduate school and earning my PhD and working in a lab advancing technology
and pushing science to its limits. A lot has happened since then. It's been
nearly ten years since I've last done a derivation or taken a derivative. A 
very long time since I've sat in a classroom, or done an experiment. However,
I want to go back and try again. I've got a plan.

# The Plan!

Over the next two years, I'm not only going to begin getting recommendations 
and transcripts and emailing professors and all that. I'm going to work on
practice problems and get back to where I was at the end of my senior year of
my undergraduate studies. This means getting through a lot of work! I'm going 
to get caught up in mathematics, chemistry, and physics. I want to go on to
work on quantum computing or novel inorganic nanomaterials.

## The Blog!

So I'm going to use this blog to keep a record. To keep myself on track. And
to maybe build an online community and support group for people like myself
who wish to go to grad school and build our math and science strengths together.
I'm also going to do more than the blog, though.

## The videos!

I'm going to do 50-ish minute recordings of me going over the meat and potatoes
of many different subjects, and maybe even some at home labs! These videos 
topics can be found below, and I will come back here and check them off as 
the series begins/ends.

 - Calculus [ ]
 - Linear Algebra [ ]
 - Engineering Math [ ]
 - Intro Physics [ ]
 - Classical Mechanics [ ]
 - Electrodynamics [ ]
 - Thermodynamics [ ]
 - Quantum Mechanics [ ]
 - Intro Chemistry [ ]
 - Organic Chemistry [ ]
 - Medicinal Chemistry [ ]
 - Inorganic Chemistry [ ]
 - Physical Chemistry [ ]

## The livestreams!

I'm going to supplement the videos with livestreams. During the live streams
I'll work on the practice problems I assigned myself during the videos. During
the livestreams I will also chat with the community and maybe even take
problems or suggestions from the audience. It's basically like office hours or
something.

## The discord!

To help build and foster a community, I'll also be running a discord server.

## The patreon!

If you wanna help out, think about donating! I'll have a buy me a coffee for
one-time donations, as well as a patreon for anyone who wants to support this
blog long-term!


This blog is a record of my journey. Wish me luck!
